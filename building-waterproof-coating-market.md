<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The building waterproof coating market can be classified into two types: dry and liquid coatings. Dry coatings are typically powders or compounds that are applied on the building surface by mixing them with water. They form a protective layer that prevents water infiltration. On the other hand, liquid coatings are ready-to-use solutions that are directly applied onto the building surface. They penetrate into the substrate and form a seamless barrier against water. Both types of coatings are widely used in the construction industry to enhance the durability and longevity of buildings.</p></p>
