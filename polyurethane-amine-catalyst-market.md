<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Amine Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reactive Amine Catalysts</li><li>Non-reactive Amine Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The polyurethane amine catalyst market can be classified into two types: reactive amine catalysts and non-reactive amine catalysts. Reactive amine catalysts are substances that actively participate in the reaction during the polyurethane formation process. They accelerate the reaction rates and enhance the properties of polyurethane. On the other hand, non-reactive amine catalysts are present in the reaction mixture but do not actively participate in the reaction. They mainly function as promoters, aiding the reactive amine catalysts in the reaction process. Both types play crucial roles in the polyurethane amine catalyst market.</p></p>
