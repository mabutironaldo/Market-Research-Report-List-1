<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler Blood Flow Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implanted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Doppler blood flow monitor market can be classified into two types: implantable and non-implanted. Implantable monitors are devices that are surgically implanted inside the body to continuously monitor blood flow. These devices are typically used for long-term monitoring in patients with chronic conditions. Non-implanted monitors, on the other hand, are external devices that do not require surgical intervention. They are commonly used for short-term monitoring in hospitals or medical facilities. Both types serve the purpose of assessing blood flow and provide valuable insights for medical professionals in diagnosing and treating various cardiovascular conditions.</p></p>
