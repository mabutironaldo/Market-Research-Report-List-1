<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Based Pressure Sensitive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent</li><li>Water-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Acrylic based pressure sensitive adhesives are commonly found in two types: solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based adhesives utilize organic solvents as the main carrier to dissolve the adhesive material and enable easy application. They offer strong bond strength and quick drying but may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be harmful to the environment and human health. On the other hand, water-based adhesives utilize water as the main carrier, ensuring minimal VOC emissions and improving safety. Although they have slightly lower bond strength and longer drying times compared to solvent-based adhesives, water-based adhesives are more environmentally friendly and safer for users.</p></p>
