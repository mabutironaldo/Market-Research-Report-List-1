<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Free Space Isolators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polarization Dependent Isolator</li><li>Polarization Independent Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Free space isolators are optical devices used to protect laser sources from back reflections and reduce noise in optical systems. They can be classified into two main types: polarization dependent isolators and polarization independent isolators. </p><p>Polarization dependent isolators allow light to pass through in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction, based on the polarization of the light. On the other hand, polarization independent isolators can separate the input and output light regardless of its polarization, making them suitable for systems where the polarization state may change.</p></p>
