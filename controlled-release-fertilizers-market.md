<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled-release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU)</li><li>Polymer-coated products</li><li>Polymer/ Sulphur-coated products</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Controlled-release fertilizers are a type of fertilizers that are designed to slowly release nutrients over an extended period of time, providing a more consistent and efficient nutrient supply to plants. </p><p>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU) is a type of controlled-release fertilizer where urea granules are coated with a layer of sulphur. This coating gradually breaks down in the soil, releasing nitrogen to the plants.</p><p>Polymer-coated products are controlled-release fertilizers where the nutrient granules are coated with a polymer layer. This polymer layer controls the release of nutrients based on factors like temperature and soil moisture, providing a controlled release of nutrients to the plants.</p><p>Polymer/Sulphur-coated products are a combination of both sulphur-coated urea and polymer-coated products. These fertilizers have a dual coating, with a polymer layer on top of the sulphur coating, providing a more precise and prolonged release of nutrients to the plants.</p></p>
