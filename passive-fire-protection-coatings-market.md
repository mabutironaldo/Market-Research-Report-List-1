<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Fire Protection Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based</li><li>Solvent-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive fire protection coatings are used to delay the spread of fire and prevent damage to structures. Water-based coatings are made of a mixture of water and other chemicals that form a protective barrier when applied to surfaces. They are environmentally friendly and easy to apply. Solvent-based coatings, on the other hand, are made with organic solvents and are more durable and resistant to damage. However, they release volatile organic compounds into the environment. Both types of coatings are effective in preventing fire spread but differ in their environmental impact and durability.</p></p>
