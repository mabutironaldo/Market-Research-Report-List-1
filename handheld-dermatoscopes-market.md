<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Dermatoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Dermatoscopes</li><li>Noncontact Dermatoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Handheld dermatoscopes are devices used for examining the skin closely to detect and diagnose skin conditions. There are two main types of handheld dermatoscopes: contact dermatoscopes and non-contact dermatoscopes. Contact dermatoscopes require direct skin contact to capture images, using built-in lighting and magnification. Non-contact dermatoscopes, on the other hand, do not require any direct contact with the skin and instead use a different method, such as polarized light technology, to examine and capture images of the skin. Both types serve the purpose of aiding dermatologists in accurate skin examination and diagnosis.</p></p>
