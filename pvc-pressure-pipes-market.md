<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Pressure Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chlorinated PVC Pipe</li><li>Unplasticized PVC Pipe</li><li>Plasticized PVC Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PVC pressure pipes market consists of three main types: chlorinated PVC pipe, unplasticized PVC pipe, and plasticized PVC pipe. Chlorinated PVC pipe is made by adding chlorine to the PVC resin, resulting in a more durable and chemically resistant pipe suitable for various applications. Unplasticized PVC pipe, also known as rigid PVC, is made without any plasticizers, resulting in a strong and rigid pipe commonly used in plumbing and construction. Plasticized PVC pipe, on the other hand, is made by adding plasticizers to the PVC resin, resulting in a flexible pipe suitable for irrigation and gardening purposes.</p></p>
