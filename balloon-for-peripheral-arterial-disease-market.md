<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon for Peripheral Arterial Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Balloon</li><li>Drug-eluting Balloon</li><li>Special Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The balloon market for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) consists of three types: ordinary balloon, drug-eluting balloon, and special balloon. The ordinary balloon is a traditional device used to dilate narrowed arteries. Drug-eluting balloons are coated with medication to prevent restenosis, which is the re-narrowing of the artery after balloon angioplasty. Special balloons are designed for specific purposes, such as cutting or scoring the plaque in the arteries. These different balloon types provide physicians with various options for treating PAD and improving blood flow in affected individuals.</p></p>
