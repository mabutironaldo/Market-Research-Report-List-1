<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plunger Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lubricating Wax</li><li>Lubricating Oil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Plunger lubricants refer to substances used to reduce friction and facilitate smooth operation of plungers in various applications. There are two main types of plunger lubricants: lubricating wax and lubricating oil. </p><p>Lubricating wax is a solid or semi-solid substance that is applied to the plunger's surface. It forms a protective layer, reducing friction and wear during operation. Lubricating waxes are often used in high-temperature environments where traditional oils may not be suitable.</p><p>Lubricating oil, on the other hand, is a liquid substance that is applied to the plunger's surfaces or injected into its housing. It flows easily, providing lubrication and preserving the plunger's performance. Lubricating oils have a wide range of viscosities and additives to offer different levels of lubrication and protection.</p></p>
