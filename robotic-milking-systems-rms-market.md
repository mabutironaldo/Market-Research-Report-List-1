<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robotic Milking Systems (RMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone Units</li><li>Multiple Stall Units</li><li>Rotary Units</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Robotic Milking Systems (RMS) have transformed the dairy industry by automating the milking process. Standalone units are individual milking stations that can be installed anywhere on the farm, allowing cows to voluntarily enter and be milked at their convenience. Multiple stall units consist of several milking stations organized into a small centralized area, accommodating more cows simultaneously. Rotary units are large-scale systems where cows are loaded onto a rotary platform that slowly rotates, enabling multiple cows to be milked at once. Each market type caters to different farm sizes and requirements.</p></p>
