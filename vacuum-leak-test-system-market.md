<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Leak Test System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasonic Leak Detector</li><li>Helium Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Vacuum Leak Test System market includes two main types: Ultrasonic Leak Detector and Helium Leak Detector. </p><p>1. Ultrasonic Leak Detectors use high-frequency sound waves to detect and locate leaks in a vacuum system. These detectors are highly sensitive and can identify even the smallest leaks by analyzing the sound waves produced.</p><p>2. On the other hand, Helium Leak Detectors use helium gas as a tracer to identify leaks. The system pressurizes the test object with helium and then detects any presence of helium in the surrounding area, thereby pinpointing the location of the leak.</p><p>Both types of detectors play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of vacuum systems by detecting and fixing leaks promptly.</p></p>
