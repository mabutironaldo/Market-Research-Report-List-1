<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Retread Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive retread tire market offers two main types: Pre-Cure and Mold Cure. In Pre-Cure retreading, a new tread rubber is applied to the tire through a bonding process using adhesives. This method allows for greater flexibility in selecting the desired tread pattern. On the other hand, Mold Cure retreading involves a process where the new tread rubber is bonded to the tire in a mold. This process provides a more uniform and durable tread, ensuring enhanced traction and longer tire life. Both methods provide cost-effective solutions for extending the lifespan of tires.</p></p>
