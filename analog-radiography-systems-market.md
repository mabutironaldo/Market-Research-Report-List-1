<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog Radiography Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Analog radiography systems are widely used in medical imaging. There are two main types of analog radiography systems: film-based and CR film cassette. In film-based systems, X-ray images are captured on a special film that requires chemical processing for development. These films are commonly used in hospitals and clinics. On the other hand, CR film cassette systems use imaging plates to capture X-ray images, which are then digitally processed and viewed on a computer screen. CR film cassette systems are known for their high image quality, ease of use, and quicker turnaround time for results.</p></p>
