<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion-proof Oil Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Type</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The explosion-proof oil filter market comprises two main types: vacuum type and centrifugal type. The vacuum type oil filters work by creating a vacuum inside the filter housing, which draws the oil through the filter media, allowing impurities to be trapped on the surface. On the other hand, centrifugal type filters use centrifugal force to separate impurities from the oil through rotation. Both types are specifically designed to prevent explosion risks in environments where flammable gases or vapors are present, ensuring safety during oil filtration processes.</p></p>
