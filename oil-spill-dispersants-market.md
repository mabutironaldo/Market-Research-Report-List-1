<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Spill Dispersants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Dispersants</li><li>Biodispersant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil spill dispersants are substances used to break up oil spills into smaller droplets, facilitating their dispersion into the water column. Chemical dispersants, the most commonly used type, contain surfactants that reduce the oil's surface tension, making it easier for it to mix with water. Biodispersants, on the other hand, are derived from natural sources such as bacteria or enzymes, promoting the breakdown of oil through biodegradation processes. Other markets in the oil spill dispersants industry include the production and distribution of equipment and technologies used for dispersant application and monitoring of oil spill effects.</p></p>
