<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Vehicle Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Control</li><li>Electromagnetic Control</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The light vehicle starter market can be categorized into two types: direct control and electromagnetic control. Direct control starters rely on a mechanical switch to directly engage and disengage the starter motor. On the other hand, electromagnetic control starters use an electromagnet to operate a switch, enabling remote control operation. While direct control starters are simpler and more cost-effective, electromagnetic control starters offer the advantage of remote control functionality, allowing drivers to start their vehicles from a distance using a key fob or a smartphone app.</p></p>
