<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnet Rings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Axial</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The magnet rings market can be categorized into two types: radial and axial. Radial magnet rings have magnetic poles located on the outer diameter of the ring, which enables magnetic flux to flow radially across the ring. These rings are commonly used in electric motors and generators. On the other hand, axial magnet rings have magnetic poles located on the surfaces facing the center of the ring, allowing the magnetic flux to flow axially (along the ring's axis). Axial magnet rings find applications in magnetic bearings and sensors.</p></p>
