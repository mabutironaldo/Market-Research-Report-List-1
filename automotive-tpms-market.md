<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) has two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors mounted inside each tire to measure tire pressure and temperature, providing real-time data to the driver. This system offers accurate and reliable readings, but can be more costly to install. On the other hand, Indirect TPMS relies on the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) sensors to indirectly determine tire pressure by monitoring wheel speed. While more affordable, Indirect TPMS is generally less precise and may require calibration.</p></p>
