<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Fireproofing Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wood fireproofing coatings can be categorized into two types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based coatings are formulated with water as the main solvent, making them environmentally friendly and easy to clean up. These coatings provide good adhesion to wood surfaces and are known for their low toxicity and lack of strong odors. On the other hand, solvent-based coatings use organic solvents as the base, offering better resistance to moisture and extreme temperatures. However, they may pose environmental and health risks due to the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p></p>
