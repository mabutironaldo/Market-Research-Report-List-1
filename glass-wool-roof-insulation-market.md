<p><strong>The Glass Wool Roof Insulation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pitch Roof Insulation</li><li>Flat Roof Insulation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Glass wool roof insulation is commonly used in both pitch roof and flat roof applications due to its excellent thermal and acoustic properties. In pitch roof insulation, glass wool is installed between the rafters to prevent heat loss during winter and heat gain during summer, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment. Similarly, in flat roof insulation, glass wool is placed on the roof surface to reduce thermal bridging and improve energy efficiency. Both applications help in reducing energy consumption, saving costs, and increasing overall comfort levels in buildings.</p></p>
