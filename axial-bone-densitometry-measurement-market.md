<p><h1>Axial Bone Densitometry Measurement Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Axial bone densitometry measurement is a diagnostic test used to assess bone mineral density and determine the risk of osteoporotic fractures. It is a noninvasive technique that measures the amount of mineral content in various regions of axial skeleton, such as the hip and spine, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or quantitative computed tomography (QCT).</p><p>The market for axial bone densitometry measurement is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. The rising prevalence of osteoporosis, especially among the aging population, is one of the major factors driving the market growth. Additionally, the increasing awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and prevention of osteoporosis is boosting the demand for axial bone densitometry measurement.</p><p>Technological advancements in DEXA and QCT systems are further expected to drive market growth. For instance, the development of portable and handheld bone densitometers has made the assessment of bone density more convenient and accessible. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence in bone densitometry systems has improved the accuracy and efficiency of the measurements.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also positively influenced the market as it has led to an increased emphasis on early diagnosis and management of chronic diseases. Furthermore, the growing adoption of telehealth and remote patient monitoring solutions during the pandemic has increased the accessibility of axial bone densitometry measurement, thereby fueling market growth.</p><p>Overall, with the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis, advancements in technology, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the axial bone densitometry measurement market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. However, factors such as the high cost of equipment and limited availability in developing regions may hinder market expansion to some extent.</p></p>
