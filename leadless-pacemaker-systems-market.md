<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leadless Pacemaker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chambered Systems</li><li>Double-Chambered Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The leadless pacemaker systems market consists of two types: single-chambered systems and double-chambered systems. Single-chambered systems are designed to treat bradycardia by stimulating the right ventricle. They are implanted directly into the heart without the need for leads. Double-chambered systems are used to treat patients with atrioventricular blockages. They have two electrodes placed within the heart, one in the right atrium and one in the right ventricle, enabling synchronized pacing. Both types eliminate the need for transvenous leads, reducing potential complications associated with traditional pacemakers.</p></p>
