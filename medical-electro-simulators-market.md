<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Electro-Simulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</li><li>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (EMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical electro-simulators market consists of two main types: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (EMS). TENS devices are used to relieve pain by transmitting low-voltage electrical currents through the skin to block pain signals. EMS devices, on the other hand, stimulate muscle contractions using electrical currents, aiding in muscle rehabilitation and strengthening. Both types of electro-simulators are non-invasive and widely used in the healthcare industry for pain management and physiotherapy purposes.</p></p>
