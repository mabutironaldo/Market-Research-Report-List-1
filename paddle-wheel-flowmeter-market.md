<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paddle Wheel Flowmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tangential-Flow Paddle Wheel Flow Meters</li><li>Axis-Flow Paddle Wheel Flow Meters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Paddle Wheel Flowmeter is a device used to measure the flow rate of liquids. There are two main types of Paddle Wheel Flowmeters: Tangential-Flow and Axis-Flow. Tangential-Flow Paddle Wheel Flow Meters have the flow passing tangentially over the paddle wheel, causing it to rotate and provide a reading. This type is suitable for low viscosity and clean fluids. On the other hand, Axis-Flow Paddle Wheel Flow Meters have the flow passing axially through the wheel, making it rotate and measure the flow. This type is ideal for high viscosity and dirty fluids.</p></p>
