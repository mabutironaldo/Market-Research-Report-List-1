<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Replacement Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The replacement tires market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of cords running radially across the tire, offering better grip, stability, and fuel efficiency. They are the most commonly used tires in modern vehicles. On the other hand, bias tires have cords running diagonally across the tire, providing greater durability and load-carrying capacity. However, they have lower fuel efficiency and are generally used in off-road vehicles or heavy-duty applications. Both types of tires cater to different needs and preferences in the replacement tires market.</p></p>
