<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber-optic sensors are classified into two main types: intrinsic fiber-optic sensors and extrinsic fiber-optic sensors. Intrinsic fiber-optic sensors are made from the same material as the fiber optic cable itself, allowing for direct measurement of physical parameter changes in the fiber. This type of sensor is commonly used in industries like telecommunications and oil and gas. On the other hand, extrinsic fiber-optic sensors use external components to interact with the fiber and measure changes. These sensors are often utilized in applications where high sensitivity and accuracy are required, such as in medical diagnostics and structural health monitoring.</p></p>
