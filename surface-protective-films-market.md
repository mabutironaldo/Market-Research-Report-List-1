<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Protective Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adhesive-free</li><li>Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surface protective films market encompasses two main types: adhesive-free films and adhesive films. Adhesive-free films are designed to adhere to surfaces without the use of any adhesive, relying instead on static electricity or low tack adhesion. These films provide temporary protection against scratches, dirt, and minor impacts. On the other hand, adhesive films use a layer of adhesive to stick to surfaces, offering more durability and long-term protection against damage from external elements. Both types cater to different needs and are widely used in various industries such as electronics, automotive, and construction.</p></p>
