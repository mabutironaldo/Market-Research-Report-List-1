<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Reinforced Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Molding Type</li><li>Extrusion Molding Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fiberglass Reinforced Grating (FRP) is available in two main market types: Compression Molding Type and Extrusion Molding Type. Compression Molding Type involves using a hydraulic press to combine fiberglass reinforcements with a thermosetting resin in a heated mold, forming solid gratings with high strength. Extrusion Molding Type, on the other hand, involves melting the resin and forcing it through a die to obtain shapes like square or rectangular bars, creating lightweight gratings. Both market types offer different manufacturing processes, resulting in varied properties and applications for FRP gratings.</p></p>
