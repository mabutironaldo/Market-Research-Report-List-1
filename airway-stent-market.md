<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airway Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracheal Stents</li><li>Laryngeal Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airway stent market consists of two major types: tracheal stents and laryngeal stents. Tracheal stents are used to provide support and maintain the patency of the windpipe (trachea). They are commonly used in patients with tracheal stenosis or tracheomalacia. On the other hand, laryngeal stents are designed to keep the airway open in individuals with laryngeal stenosis or vocal cord paralysis. Both types of stents are instrumental in improving breathing and preventing respiratory difficulties in patients with airway obstructions.</p></p>
