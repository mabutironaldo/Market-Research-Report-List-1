<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indoor Wireless Coverage and Objects Localization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Cells</li><li>Distributed Antenna System (DAS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The indoor wireless coverage market primarily consists of two types: small cells and Distributed Antenna System (DAS). Small cells are low-power wireless access points that are placed indoors to enhance cellular coverage and capacity. They are typically deployed in areas with high user density, such as shopping malls or airports. DAS, on the other hand, is a network of antennas connected to a central hub, providing wireless coverage to larger indoor areas like stadiums or office buildings. Both technologies aim to improve wireless connectivity and ensure better indoor signal strength and quality.</p></p>
